# Gamestore_with_FastAPI

A project made using Python, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap by using the FastAPI web framework. This project is made to simulate an e-commerce store for
a particluar game to showcase its virtual items and handle transactions between gamers regarding the sale of items. This project is similar to 
my previous Gamestore Project and serves to showcase the usage of ASGIs and type safety during deployment of web apps. It also shows how FastAPI, while
similar to Flask , is also different from it in various ways.
